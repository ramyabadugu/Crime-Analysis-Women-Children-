# Crime Against Women and Children (2019–2021) – Data Visualization Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing crime data related to **women** and **children** across various Indian states and Union Territories from **2019 to 2021**. Using **Excel** for data preprocessing and **Tableau** for visualizations, the goal is to uncover trends, identify high-risk regions, and support informed public awareness through visual storytelling.

## Tools Used

- **Tableau** – Interactive dashboards & visual storytelling
- **Microsoft Excel** – Data cleaning, transformation, and summary calculations

## Objectives

- Understand the yearly trend of crimes against women and children.
- Identify states/UTs with the highest and lowest crime rates.
- Compare data across years (2019, 2020, 2021) to observe changes during/after COVID.
- Visualize data in an easy-to-understand format to raise awareness.

## Key Features

- **State-wise comparison** using bar charts and heat maps
- **Year-over-year analysis** using line and area graphs
- **Pie charts** for distribution of crime types 
- **Dynamic filters** for interactive exploration (Tableau dashboards)

## Insights Derived

- Identified top 5 states with consistently high reported crimes
- Observed a drop in reported cases during 2020, possibly due to lockdown restrictions
- Found significant variations between states, indicating regional disparities

## How to View the Dashboard

- Download and open the `.twbx` file in **Tableau Public** or **Tableau Desktop**.
- Use the filters to explore trends by year, state, and type of crime.

## Future Scope

- Combine this data with population statistics to calculate crime rate per capita.
- Extend the project to include crimes against senior citizens or other vulnerable groups.
- Integrate maps for better geographic insights.
